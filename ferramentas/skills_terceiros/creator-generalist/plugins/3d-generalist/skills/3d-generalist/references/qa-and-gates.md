# Automated Anti-Slop QA and Render Gates (`qa-and-gates.md`)

Never trust a single preview or code change by eye alone. Numbers miss what a frame shows, and a single still misses
what happens between frames. Every 3D video must pass **both** automated numerical checks at 30 fps and visual contact
sheet inspection before the user sees a preview.

## 1. The 10-point Preview Gate

Run these checks across the entire film at 30 fps (`window.placeTime(t)` for fast geometry checks without rendering, and
real page renders for visibility checks). **One failure blocks the preview.**

| Gate | Threshold / Rule | What it catches |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Contact & Support** | Lowest vertices of every stone, prop, structure and planted foot/knee/hip sit within **1 to 2 cm** of the real mesh below (at least 3 contact points for stones). Base is lit and visible. | Floating stones, hovering workers, crouching past a cliff edge, towers floating on dark unlit islands. |
| **2. Flight Check** | Both heels and both toes are never >3 cm above the surface under them at the same time outside `airborne` jump/climb/dance beats. | Walk cycles or kneel transitions that hop into the air for 5 to 7 frames. |
| **3. Foot Slip** | Any heel or toe within 3 cm of the ground moves at **<0.25 m/s** (no slide lasting 3+ frames). Turns pivot on the ball of the foot. | Moonwalking, skating during clip blends, pushing a cart faster than stride speed. |
| **4. Teleport & Speed** | Character hips move **<0.30 m per frame** and walk speed stays **<2.0 m/s** over any 0.3 s window. Camera cuts happen inside 1 frame interval. The camera never jumps >0.3 m or >15° in one frame except at a cut in the shot list, and never cuts to a reverse angle (>90°). | Word-anchored walk keys that jump 0.9 m after audio trimming, or slow pans across a teleport gap. |
| **5. Hand Grip & Cause** | Both palms sit within **3 cm** of the gripped surface or handle on every active frame. No prop, door, fire or mechanism moves without a hold, grip or explicit `free` physics flag. | Pulling a chain hanging in mid-air, buckets pouring sideways 0.6 m from the pan, cranks spinning on their own. |
| **6. Clearance** | Hard hat, head, chest, hips, thighs, knees and shins never penetrate a box surface, wall, door leaf or spoil mound (>5 cm brush). On a hand-to-face grip the forearm midpoint stays ≥3 cm off the chest. Standing hips stay above ~0.65 m (1.8 m character) outside kneel, sit and crouch beats. | Stopping mid-stride with a toe 27 cm inside a door or 44 cm inside a hearth; blocks passing through the head. |
| **7. Abrupt Exit & Vanish** | No mesh, trail, flow line, sprite or label goes from visible to hidden (or jumps >15 cm) between two adjacent frames without an ease-out motion. Old beat props leave when the beat ends. | Wind lines or labels snapping off in 1 frame; rain, dung or tools lingering into the next beat. |
| **8. Chip Hygiene** | Every on-screen label chip is a technical part name actually spoken in the narration, shown for at least 1 s and hidden 1.5–2 s after the word. | Number chips (`"62 BC"`), place chips (`"HAWAII"`), or a card naming the final object at the end. |
| **9. Caption & Voice Sync** | Every spoken word's caption appears within **±0.05 s** of the mean of 3 ASR transcriptions. Zero internal voice silences >0.4 s. Duration is 55 to 65 s for Shorts. | Drifting captions, ElevenLabs trailing 1.5 s full-stop stalls, padded waits (*"6 months later..."*). |
| **10. Contact Sheet Visual Review** | Inspect `scripts/contact-sheet.sh` grids at 1 fps (and per-shot stills) to verify silhouettes, elbow angles, pour alignment, water levels and lighting. | Backward carts, backwards arms, black `NaN` water patches, dark faces inside cutaways. |

## 2. Keeping QA checks fast (<30 seconds)

- Expose `window.placeTime(seconds)` on the scene page so `scripts/check_contact_and_slip.mjs` updates transforms and
  skeletons without running the WebGL pixel shader or post-processing passes.
- Skip instanced grass blades, rain/snow particles and camera-sized sky domes when building raycast BVH caches, and
  reuse static mesh BVHs across frames.
- Render the fast **540p preview** (`scale = 0.5`, `blur = 1`) first, mux with the -14 LUFS audio mix, run the gate, and
  render the **1080p 6-subframe motion-blur final** only after user sign-off.
