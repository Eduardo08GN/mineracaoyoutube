## 5.x names

- Add-ons moved to Extensions in 4.2. Node Wrangler, Loop Tools, Rigify, Modifier Tools, Extra Objects, Images as Planes, A.N.T. Landscape are bundled or one click in Preferences > Get Extensions. Third-party zips install with the Install from Disk menu.
- Material and World `use_nodes` is deprecated and removed in 6.0. Nodes are always on, a new material already has a Principled node tree.
- Render engine id is `BLENDER_EEVEE` in 5.2 (Eevee Next). Old `BLENDER_EEVEE_NEXT` and `BLENDER_EEVEE_LEGACY` ids are gone.
- Node idnames use the pattern `GeometryNode...`, `ShaderNode...`, `FunctionNode...`. Renamed nodes keep working only under the new idname, for example `FunctionNodeAlignRotationToVector`.
- Group interface uses `tree.interface.new_socket(...)` since 4.0.

## Headless and bpy recipes

- **Run headless safely**: Use `blender -b <file.blend> -t 6 -P script.py -- args` (machine paths in `../local.md` when present). Args after `--` reach `sys.argv`. Start it at below-normal priority, bakes use `-t 6`, never two heavy jobs at once, and GPU jobs follow the project's queue rules.
- **Render one still**: `blender.exe -b scene.blend -o //out/frame_#### -F PNG -f 1`. Animation: `-s 1 -e 48 -a`. Engine override: `-E BLENDER_EEVEE` or `-E CYCLES`. Set resolution in the script (`scene.render.resolution_x`) and low samples for previews.
- **Geometry nodes tree by script** (ran on 5.2.2): create `tree = bpy.data.node_groups.new("Name", "GeometryNodeTree")`, add `tree.interface.new_socket(name="Geometry", in_out="INPUT", socket_type="NodeSocketGeometry")` and the same with `OUTPUT`. Add nodes with `tree.nodes.new("GeometryNodeDistributePointsOnFaces")`, link with `tree.links.new(a.outputs["Points"], b.inputs["Points"])` using socket names, not indexes, where possible. Attach with `modifier = obj.modifiers.new("Name", "NODES")` then `modifier.node_group = tree`. Find an idname by adding the node in the UI, then reading `bl_idname` in the Python console (unverified shortcut: the Python tooltips setting shows it on hover).
- **Modifiers by script**: `obj.modifiers.new("Sub", "SUBSURF")`, `"MIRROR"`, `"SOLIDIFY"`, `"ARRAY"`, `"SKIN"`, `"BEVEL"`, `"DISPLACE"`, `"SHRINKWRAP"`. Apply with `bpy.ops.object.modifier_apply(modifier="Sub")` with the object active, top to bottom.
- **Shader nodes by script**: `mat = bpy.data.materials.new("M")`, then `mat.node_tree.nodes` and `.links`. Nodes: `ShaderNodeBsdfPrincipled`, `ShaderNodeEmission`, `ShaderNodeMixShader`, `ShaderNodeTexNoise`, `ShaderNodeMapRange`, `ShaderNodeValToRGB` (Color Ramp), `ShaderNodeMix` (new Mix, set `data_type`).
- **Check before handing off**: render one still, open the PNG and read it. Check node-tree errors by `tree.nodes` having no node with `bl_idname == "NodeUndefined"`, and read the console for "Warning" lines.
- **Python deprecations**: DeprecationWarning lines for `use_nodes` are noise. Remove them by not setting it.

## Node editor habits

- **Node Wrangler**: Shift+right-drag adds reroutes, Alt+right-drag lazy connect, Ctrl+T texture setup (Texture Coordinate + Mapping), Ctrl+Shift+click preview a shader node, Alt+Shift+click preview a geometry node, F connects selected sockets by name. M mute, Ctrl+J frame, F2 rename, drag from a socket and release to search.
- **Groups**: Ctrl+G, Tab, N > Group tab to add and rename inputs (drag the empty socket), Item tab for label and name. Number button = users, press for single user. Shield = fake user. Append the node tree to other files and Save Startup File. Math Divide by 1000 gives fine control of a value.
- **`#frame` instant driver**: type `#frame` in any value field, divide for slower motion. Copy as New Driver and Paste Driver link two fields.

## Viewport and preference habits

- **Setup**: Save the startup file after deleting the default cube (File > Defaults > Save Startup File). Preferences > Navigation: Auto Depth, Zoom to Mouse Position, Orbit Around Selection. Raise undo steps. Matcap + Cavity (Both) viewport. Save Fake User for groups.
- **Selection**: L selects an island, the operator panel after Select Linked delimits by Material, Seam, Sharpness or UVs. Shift+G Select Similar. Ctrl+I inverts, H hides.
- **Edit many at once**: Hold Alt while changing a value to edit all selected objects (modifiers, lights, nodes, bone Deform).
- **Misc hotkeys**: Ctrl+F2 batch rename (find and replace, bones, materials, nodes). Type units into fields (7' 6"). Object > Link/Transfer Data > Copy Modifiers (Ctrl+L). Convert to Mesh applies modifiers. Alt-click Apply on a modifier applies many. Ctrl+1/2/3 Subdivision level. Shift+backtick fly mode. Duplicate Collection as backup.
- **Multiple versions**: Blender Launcher (free) runs alpha builds and several versions.
- **Cycles GPU**: Preferences > System > OptiX. Light Paths raise Transparent, Transmission and Total bounces when planes or glass show black blobs. Open Image Denoise in Render settings instead of compositor nodes.

## Add-ons, free vs paid

Check the licence and price before use, notes are from the videos and may have changed.

Joey's own Gumroad also has free node groups, a palette and a simple rig. Do not assume availability, the references reproduce the node setups.
- **BlockBlender (Minecraft blocks)**: Install: Preferences > File Paths > Asset Libraries > +, put the .blend in that folder, drag the "BlockBlender Importer" from the Asset Browser (or File > Append > Object), delete the importer. Model: scale, Ctrl+A apply all, Ctrl+J join, Geometry Nodes modifier > BlockBlender, Image = base-colour texture, Resolution 1 (in-game scale) to 0.1 to 0.2. Make Instances Real speeds the viewport. Image: Images as Planes, Subdivisions ~7, Resolution ~0.03, Exterior Thickness or extrude by one resolution, Delete Alpha 1. Text: Shift+A > Text, R X 90, Geometry > Extrude, convert to mesh. Palettes by UV (select all, scale 0, move the point to a swatch). Vertex colours: Use Color Attribute 1. Block counter: realize off, Instances ID in the spreadsheet or a Viewer node. glTF export: Convert to Mesh, UV attribute back to a UV map, plain Principled BSDF, Opaque, glTF with Selected, +Y Up, vertex colours off. Walk preview: F3 Walk Navigation.
- **MagicaVoxel pipeline**: Export PLY (clean topology, OBJ has overlaps), import Stanford PLY, M > By Distance, Color Attribute into Base Color, bake to UV for game use.

## Assets and sources

- Poly Haven and ambientCG: CC0 HDRIs and textures. Sketchfab importer: check each model licence, Sketchfab itself may need sign-in. Pexels free photos. Blender Studio free rigs. Polycam for photo scans.
- Nintendo Mii assets, converter tools and DeviantArt model rips were used only as references in the source videos, check licences before reuse.
- Off topic content in the source notes (CSS shapes, em and rem graphics, VCV Rack) was dropped from this skill.

## Hotkey and workflow tricks

- **Grow, shrink, invert selection**: Edit mode, Ctrl+Numpad+ grows, Ctrl+Numpad- shrinks, Ctrl+I inverts. Select More follows connected geometry.
- **Clear transforms and redo panel**: Alt+G clears location, Alt+R rotation, Alt+S scale. F9 reopens the Adjust Last Operation panel after you closed it.
- **View Selected and View All**: Numpad period frames the selection. A then Shift+C frames the whole scene and resets the 3D cursor.
- **Randomize Transform**: select the objects, Object > Transform > Randomize Transform (or F3). Set origins first. Example: Rotation Z up to 32 degrees, other fields 0.
- **Vertex parenting**: select the child, Shift+click the parent, Tab, select three vertices, Ctrl+P > Vertex (Triangle). The child rides the surface (droplets on leaves, bubbles on an egg edge).
- **Sculpt and view keys**: G Grab, V Draw, I Inflate, Shift+C Crease, S Smooth in the sculpt brush list. F resizes the brush and Shift+F sets strength. Shift+N recalculates normals when shading looks wrong. F3 finds Grid Fill, Smooth Vertices, Symmetrize and Bridge Edge Loops. With a Subdivision modifier, the Vertex view (on cage) button edits the smoothed shape. Camera focal length about 95 for character work.
- **Overlay toggle on Tilde**: Preferences > Keymap, search "context toggle", assign it to Tilde in the 3D View. F2 rename is the free "F2" extension.
- **Startup file without the cube**: delete the cube, File > Defaults > Save Startup File. Load Factory Settings undoes it.
- **Clean file for animation**: paste the rig into a new .blend, animate there, then File > Append the action into the main file and type its name in the Action Editor. Avoids viewport lag.
